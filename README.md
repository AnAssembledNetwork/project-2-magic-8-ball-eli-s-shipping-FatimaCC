# Magic 8 Ball & Eli's Shipping

This was the second project that was assigned. I had a whole week to complete it in its totality.
The project consisted on code two differents programs into one program.
This project helped me a lot to practice the following properties of functions :
-How the parameters of the functions work.
-How the main function is used to call a specific function.
-How to reuse a chunck of code multiple times.
-It also help me to practice string indexing

## Magic 8 Ball

For magic 8 ball I had to code a program that ask the user their name and a question that they would like to have an aswer to.
Then once the program has the question of the user the next thing is to choose a random answer from the magic 8 ball and  print 
them a statement with their first name, their question and the random answer from the magic ball.

## Eli's Shipping

For Eli's shipping I had to code a program that ask the user to input the weight of their package and then the program would 
check what are the shpping costs  depending on the way that they would like to send their package (Ground Shipping, Ground
Shipping Premium or Drone Shipping). At the end of the program it would print a helpful statement to the user to let them know 
which shipping method is more convenient for them to send the package and save the most money.
